# Examples and Patterns

> **Status**: ðŸš§ **Placeholder** - This guide is planned for future development

This guide will provide comprehensive code examples and common patterns for HSU development.

## Planned Content

### Working Examples
- Complete, runnable HSU implementations
- Real-world use case demonstrations
- Performance benchmarking examples
- Integration patterns with external systems

### Common Patterns
- Service composition strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Logging and monitoring implementations
- Testing approaches
- Deployment configurations

### Use Case Gallery
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Batch and stream processing HSUs
- **ML Inference Service**: Model serving with auto-scaling
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and transformation
- **Monitoring System**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **File Processing**: Document transformation and storage
- **Message Queue Integration**: Pub/sub patterns

### Anti-Patterns
- What to avoid when building HSUs
- Common mistakes and their solutions
- Performance pitfalls
- Security concerns

## Current Examples

The HSU platform currently includes these working examples:

### Echo Service
- **Location**: `hsu-example3-common/` directory
- **Purpose**: Basic gRPC service demonstration
- **Languages**: Go and Python implementations
- **Features**: Simple request/response pattern

### Echo Client
- **Location**: `hsu-echo-cli-go/` directory  
- **Purpose**: HSU client implementation
- **Features**: Connection management, health checking, concurrent requests

### Echo Servers
- **Go Server**: `hsu-example3-srv-go/` - Demonstrates integrated HSU pattern
- **Python Server**: `hsu-example3-srv-py/` - Cross-language implementation

## Quick Start

Try the existing examples:

```bash
# Start Go server
cd hsu-example3-srv-go
make build && make run

# In another terminal, run client
cd hsu-echo-cli-go  
make build && ./bin/echogrpccli --port 50055
```

## Contributing Examples

We need more real-world examples! Here's how you can contribute:

### 1. Identify a Use Case
- Choose a real problem that HSUs can solve
- Consider different domains (data, ML, web services, etc.)
- Think about scalability and integration requirements

### 2. Implement the Solution
- Follow patterns from existing guides
- Include both master and HSU implementations
- Add comprehensive testing
- Document the architecture decisions

### 3. Create Documentation
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Architecture diagrams
- Performance characteristics
- Deployment instructions

### 4. Submit Your Example
- Create a new directory in the examples structure
- Include README with clear instructions
- Add to this examples catalog
- Submit as a pull request

## Planned Example Categories

### **Beginner Examples**
- Simple CRUD service
- File upload/download service
- Configuration service
- Health monitoring dashboard

### **Intermediate Examples**
- Distributed cache implementation
- Message broker integration
- Database connection pooling
- Rate limiting service

### **Advanced Examples**
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform
- Real-time analytics pipeline
- Machine learning model serving
- Distributed transaction coordinator

### **Integration Examples**
- Kubernetes deployment
- Docker Compose setup
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
