# HSU Repository Framework Overview

**Date**: January 2, 2025  
**Status**: Framework Definition  
**Context**: Mature architecture framework validated through practical implementation

## Executive Summary

The **HSU Repository Portability Framework** is a practical approach to organizing domain-centric code that achieves true "repo-portability" - the ability to move code between different repository structures without modification. This framework emerged from successful implementation and extensive real-world validation.

## Key Innovation: Universal Repo-Portability

### Core Insight
**Repo-portability is achieved through logical purpose separation and portable import schemes, not specific folder structures.** This fundamental breakthrough enables seamless migration between repository architectures without code changes.

### The Breakthrough
Traditional approaches force developers to choose between:
- ❌ **Language-specific tooling** OR **innovative repository organization**
- ❌ **Simple structure** OR **multi-language coordination**  
- ❌ **Team scaling** OR **development simplicity**

The HSU framework **eliminates these trade-offs** by recognizing that portability comes from:
- ✅ **Clean logical boundaries** between components
- ✅ **Consistent import schemes** across all architectures
- ✅ **Purpose-driven folder organization** that works with language conventions

## Framework Principles

### 1. Language Tool Compatibility
**Principle**: Work within existing language ecosystems, not against them.

```bash
# Go tools work naturally
go build ./cmd/srv/...
go test ./pkg/...

# Python tools work naturally  
pip install -e .
python -m srv.run_server
```

**Impact**: Full IDE support, familiar patterns, zero learning curve for language-specific development.

### 2. Logical Purpose Separation
**Principle**: Organize code by logical purpose, creating portable units.

```bash
# Portable units work across all architectures
/pkg/domain/     # Shared business logic
/cmd/srv/        # Server implementations  
/cmd/cli/        # Client implementations
/api/proto/      # API definitions
```

**Impact**: Any logical unit can move between repositories without code changes.

### 3. Import Consistency
**Principle**: Identical imports across all repository architectures.

```go
// IDENTICAL imports in all approaches
import "github.com/org/hsu-echo/pkg/domain"
import "github.com/org/hsu-echo/pkg/control"

// Magic happens in go.mod replace directives:
// Single-language: replace github.com/org/hsu-echo => .
// Multi-language:  replace github.com/org/hsu-echo => . (in /go/go.mod)
// Multi-repo:      require github.com/org/hsu-echo-common v1.0.0
```

**Impact**: True portability - code works without modification across architectures.

### 4. Progressive Evolution
**Principle**: Support natural growth from simple to complex.

```bash
# Evolution path
Approach 1 → Approach 2 → Approach 3
Simple     → Coordinated → Scalable
```

**Impact**: Start simple, scale naturally, never hit architectural dead ends.

## Framework Capabilities

### Multi-Architecture Support
The framework provides **three distinct approaches** that can be mixed and matched:

- **Zero Migration Overhead**: Identical code works across all approaches
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Real examples, tested workflows

## Technical Foundation

### Import Resolution Magic
The framework's key technical innovation is **import path consistency** achieved through clever build configuration:

**Single-Language Repository:**
```go
// File: /pkg/domain/handler.go
module github.com/org/hsu-echo-go
replace github.com/org/hsu-echo => .

import "github.com/org/hsu-echo/pkg/domain"  // Works!
```

**Multi-Language Repository:**
```go  
// File: /go/pkg/domain/handler.go
module github.com/org/hsu-echo/go
replace github.com/org/hsu-echo => .

import "github.com/org/hsu-echo/pkg/domain"  // IDENTICAL import!
```

**Multi-Repository Architecture:**
```go
// File: hsu-echo-srv-go/cmd/srv/main.go
module github.com/org/hsu-echo-srv-go
require github.com/org/hsu-echo-common v1.0.0

import "github.com/org/hsu-echo-common/pkg/domain"  // External dependency
```

### Folder Portability Rules

#### **Rule 1: Language Folder Handling**
```bash
# Moving TO multi-language repo (ADD language folder)
Source: /pkg/domain/handler.go  
Target: /go/pkg/domain/handler.go

# Moving FROM multi-language repo (STRIP language folder)
Source: /go/pkg/domain/handler.go
Target: /pkg/domain/handler.go

# CRITICAL: Imports remain IDENTICAL in both cases!
```

#### **Rule 2: Purpose Preservation**
```bash
# Portable units maintain their logical purpose
/pkg/        → Shared libraries (Go convention)
/cmd/srv/    → Server implementations
/cmd/cli/    → Client implementations  
/api/proto/  → API definitions
/lib/        → Shared libraries (Python convention)
/srv/        → Server implementations (Python)
/cli/        → Client implementations (Python)
```

## Integration with HSU Ecosystem

### Universal Makefile System
All repository approaches integrate seamlessly with the [HSU Universal Makefile System](../makefile_guide/index.md):

```makefile
# Approach 1: Single-language commands
make build          # Build all components
make run-srv        # Run server
make test          # Run tests

# Approach 2: Language-specific commands  
make go-build      # Build Go components
make py-build      # Build Python components  
make go-run-srv    # Run Go server
make py-run-srv    # Run Python server

# Approach 3: Repository-specific commands
make build         # Build current repo
make test-common   # Test shared components
make deploy-srv    # Deploy server implementation
```

### HSU Core Integration
- **Process Management**: Unified process lifecycle across all approaches
- **gRPC Infrastructure**: Automatic service registration and discovery
- **Cross-Language Communication**: Seamless Go ↔ Python coordination
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Centralized observability

### Protocol Buffer Integration
- **API-First Design**: Shared `.proto` definitions across languages
- **Automatic Code Generation**: `make proto-gen` in all approaches

## Validation & Maturity

### Production-Tested Examples
The framework has been **validated through working implementations**:

- **hsu-example1-go**: Approach 1 validated with Go ecosystem
